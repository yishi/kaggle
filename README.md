# kaggle

I heard of kaggle 5 years ago, but several weeks ago I just activated my kaggle account, because one of my colleague proposed to do kaggle competitions together.

Below competitions are benefical to me and enlarging my horizon, especially the process of coding and thingking and study winner's code.I should do competitions earlier, so *delay* is actually a bad habit.

##[Competition Series 1: Forecast use of a city bike share system](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yishi/kaggle/blob/master/competition_series_1_bike.ipynb)

Data come from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand).

This is my first kaggle competition.
